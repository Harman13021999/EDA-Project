In this project, I first cleaned the raw data of global deaths in the world since 1990 and then analyzed the cause of some particular deaths since 1990.
I also grouped the countries with their particular continent and saw which was the no. 1 cause of death in every continent since 1990.
We can further detail the death cause in particular countries as well.
